# Doom-RPI
This repository is a collection of scripts made by me for RPI and RetroPie

The main purpose of this repository is to provide scripts that feature additional ports, configuration and testing platform
for the source ports of the PC game DooM on Raspberry Pi and the RetroPie project.

**To clone scriptmodules into RetroPie-Setup, replace the "example.sh" with the name of the scriptmodule and use the command in terminal or CLI:**
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tpo1990/Doom-RPI/master/scriptmodules/example.sh -P /home/pi/RetroPie-Setup/scriptmodules/ports/

For help, please create a thread on the RetroPie forum website.

**Notice:** The scripts, configurations and the files of the repository has been tested and are provided as it is.
You should always make sure that you have a backup in case anything goes wrong.
